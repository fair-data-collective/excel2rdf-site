# excel2rdf
This repository describes a simple workflow and associated tools for converting an Excel sheet to a SKOS-based controlled vocabulary that can be uploaded to:
- BioPortal and used in CEDAR templates
- Jena Fuseki graph database to be served via SKOSMOS

thus making them machine-actionable and human readable at the same time.
