# excel2rdf

This repository contains source files and the `readthedocs` configuration for maintaining and producing the following online resource:

[https://excel2rdf.readthedocs.io/](https://excel2rdf.readthedocs.io/)

The above online resource describes a simple workflow and associated tools for converting an Excel sheet to a SKOS-based controlled vocabulary that can be uploaded to:

- [BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/) and used in [CEDAR](cedar.metadatacenter.org/) templates
- [Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) graph database to be served using [SKOSMOS](http://www.skosmos.org/)

thus making them machine-actionable and human readable at the same time.
